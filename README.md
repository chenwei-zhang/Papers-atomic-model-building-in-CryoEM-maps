## 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

This repository provides an overview and implementation of various methods used in atomic model building. These methods leverage a combination of machine learning, deep learning, and other computational approaches to predict the structure of molecules at the atomic level.

## 2. Background<a name="background"></a>

Understanding the 3D structure of molecules is crucial for various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, biology, and material science. Traditional methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have limitations, and computational techniques have emerged as powerful tools to address these challenges.

## 3. Methods<a name="methods"></a>

### 3.1. Ab Initio Methods<a name="ab-initio-methods"></a>

Ab initio methods are based on fundamental physical principles and solve the Schr√∂dinger equation to predict molecular structure. They are computationally intensive and used for small molecules.

### 3.2. Homology Modeling<a name="homology-modeling"></a>

Homology modeling builds atomic models by using the known structure of a homologous protein as a template. It is particularly useful when there is a significant sequence similarity.

### 3.3. Comparative Modeling<a name="comparative-modeling"></a>

Comparative modeling is a broader term that encompasses homology modeling. It refers to any method that builds a model based on the known structure of a related molecule.

### 3.4. Machine Learning-based Methods<a name="machine-learning-based-methods"></a>

These methods use machine learning algorithms to predict atomic structures. They are faster than ab initio methods and are applicable to larger molecules.

#### 3.4.1. AlphaFold<a name="alphafold"></a>

AlphaFold is a deep learning-based method developed by DeepMind that has achieved significant success in predicting protein structures.

#### 3.4.2. RoseTTAFold<a name="rosettafold"></a>

RoseTTAFold is another deep learning-based method that combines aspects of the Rosetta software suite with deep learning techniques.

#### 3.4.3. DeepMind's DMPfold<a name="deepminds-dmpfold"></a>

DMPfold is a method developed by DeepMind that combines deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for accurate structure prediction.

### 3.5. Hybrid Approaches<a name="hybrid-approaches"></a>

Hybrid methods combine multiple techniques, such as machine learning and ab initio methods, to improve accuracy and efficiency in atomic model building.

## 4. Implementation<a name="implementation"></a>
